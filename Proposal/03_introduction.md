# Introduction

## Social motivation

**Main-point: The needs for researching about privacy**

We are living in the world of Big Data, and we are providing our data to hundreds of applications every-day, which is most of the time, we don't really aware what we are sharing to the application-corporate. For instances, if someone uses iOS/Android devices, then they provides their information to Apple/Google for account management; the company also tracks the behaviors on the device to improve the the user experience; improve the relevant advertisement visibility; ... then every-time they used Facebook/Twitter/any-social-app, they provide photos/face identity/hobbies/interests/politics perspectives/... via direct posting or just a reaction button; then every-time they go to any websites in the Internet, surely they will be tracked with Google Analytics/Adobe Tag Manager/... or self-implemented tracker via cookies.

After the scandal of Cambridge Analytics and Facebook in 2018 released, people are more concerning on their privacy on digital platforms (in a survey of Raymond James Investment firm, 84% of Facebook users concerned about how the App used their data). No-one wants their data to be using without their consent, also, no-one wants to be known so-well and be manipulated / be driven - especially in the politics perspective.

To protect the privacy right of people, one-of the latest and strict regulation is released in 2018 under the name General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in European - effective for all European companies. This regulation, in general, protect the right-to-control (and right-to-delete) personal data of EU-citizen.

However, to comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations, the system (e.g: the health-app tracking heartbeat, the recommendation system,...) needs to be designed differently. Take an example of recommendation system, the algorithm likes Apriori and Collaborative Filtering will "remember who-is-who", and can be used to re-identify the user; which doesn't protect the privacy at all.

## Urgency of this study

people are more concern about the privacy in recent years, at most after the scandal of Cambridge Analytics and Facebook in 2018 and the effective of GDPR in European (General Data Protection Regulation).
