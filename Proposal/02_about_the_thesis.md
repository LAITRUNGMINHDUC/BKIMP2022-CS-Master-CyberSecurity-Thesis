# About The Thesis

## Topic

Preserving privacy for Publishing Time-series data with Differential Privacy

## Objectives

1. To study the core principles and multiple mechanisms of Differential Privacy on Time-series Dataset
   
2. To study the features and properties of Time-series Analysis; and evaluate the impact of data utility of Differential Privacy on Time-series data; and pointing out the use-cases of each algorithms.

3. To build a demonstration that using multiple mechanisms in Differential Privacy on the Time-series data from public-data-source (aggregated traffic data; revenue product sales;...) 

4. To write a report and technical document for the demo of this study.


## Methodology

1. Research from academic papers in Differential Privacy fields, and Differential Privacy for Time-series sub-fields; thereby, collecting and proposing a list of algorithms that fit the requirement to conduct the deeper analysis.

2. Research from academic papers and from corporate knowledge (in Finance and Supply Chain area) on Time-Series Analysis; thereby, reviewing the data utility by extracting time-series features of privacy-protection versions versus the original one; then building use-cases of Differential Privacy for each time-series dataset features.

3. Based on the foundation and algorithms from #1 and #2; thereby, implementing multiple Differential Privacy mechanisms for Time-series, and conducting the comparison for those mechanisms on multiple Time-series data on Python.

4. Incrementally write up the report until completion as planned (16 weeks).

## Thesis Layout

1. A brief introduction about the social motivation on Data Privacy in the Big Data era; the impact on individual privacy of Time-series analysis on Big Data; the benefits and risks of Publishing Time-series data for outsourcing analytics; and the Differential Privacy research area as the emerging research fields.

2. A detail analysis of current privacy-protection mechanisms: *Anoynization, k-Anonimity, l-Diversity, PCA,...*; the constraint of the algorithms in Big Data era; and some attack techniques to: *de-identification, re-identification, linkage attack, aggregation and statistics,...*.

3. A detail introduction Differential Privacy and its state-of-the-art techniques *(Laplace noise, Gaussian noise, Kalman filtering,...)* on Time-series Dataset.

4. Proposing and implementing multiple Differential Privacy techniques for Time-series data on Python.

5. Conducting the comparison between multiple Differential Privacy techniques and auditing the data utility of the output with Time-series Analysis; then pointing out the characteristics of dataset to choose the best fit algorithms.

6. The conclusion of the study for selected topic.
